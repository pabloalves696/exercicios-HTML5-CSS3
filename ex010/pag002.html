        Sobre
        O México é um país situado entre os Estados Unidos e a América Central, conhecido pelas praias no Pacífico e no
        Golfo do México e pela paisagem diversificada que inclui montanhas, desertos e selvas. Ruínas antigas, como
        Teotihuacán e a cidade maia de Chichén Itzá, estão espalhadas pelo país, assim como cidades da era colonial
        espanhola. Na capital, Cidade do México, lojas elegantes, museus renomados e restaurantes gourmet atendem às
        necessidades da vida moderna. ― Google

        Mexico, country of southern North America and the third largest country in Latin America, after Brazil and
        Argentina. Mexican society is characterized by extremes of wealth and poverty, with a limited middle class
        wedged between an elite cadre of landowners and investors on the one hand and masses of rural and urban poor on
        the other. But in spite of the challenges it faces as a developing country, Mexico is one of the chief economic
        and political forces in Latin America. It has a dynamic industrial base, vast mineral resources, a wide-ranging
        service sector, and the worlds largest population of Spanish speakers—about two and a half times that of Spain
        or Colombia. As its official name suggests, the Estados Unidos Mexicanos (United Mexican States) incorporates 31
        socially and physically diverse states and the Federal District.

        Mexico
        More than half of the Mexican people live in the centre of the country, whereas vast areas of the arid north and
        the tropical south are sparsely settled. Migrants from impoverished rural areas have poured into Mexicos
        cities, and nearly four-fifths of Mexicans now live in urban areas. Mexico City, the capital, is one of the most
        populous cities and metropolitan areas in the world. Mexico has experienced a series of economic booms leading
        to periods of impressive social gains, followed by busts, with significant declines in living standards for the
        middle and lower classes. The country remains economically fragile despite the forging of stronger ties with the
        United States and Canada through the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

        Mexicos urban growing pains are in sharp counterpoint to the traditional lifestyles that prevail in
        more-isolated rural areas. In states such as Oaxaca or Chiapas, small communal villages remain where indigenous
        peasants live much as their ancestors did. The cultural remnants of great pre-Columbian civilizations, such as
        Teotihuacán or the Mayan pyramids at Chichén Itzá and Tulum, provide a contrast to colonial towns such as Taxco
        or Querétaro. In turn, these towns appear as historical relics when compared with the modern metropolis of
        Mexico City. Yet even the bustling capital city, which has been continually built and rebuilt on the rubble of
        past civilizations, reveals Mexicos wide range of social, economic, and cultural struggles. As the renowned
        Mexican poet and intellectual Octavio Paz observed,
