    <h1>History</h1>
    <h2>Indigenous civilizations before European contact (pre-1519)</h2>
    <p>
        The earliest human artifacts in Mexico are chips of stone tools found near campfire remains in the Valley of
        Mexico and radiocarbon-dated to circa 10,000 years ago.[37] Mexico is the site of the domestication of maize,
        tomato, and beans, which produced an agricultural surplus. This enabled the transition from paleo-Indian
        hunter-gatherers to sedentary agricultural villages beginning around 5000 BCE.[38] In the subsequent formative
        eras, maize cultivation and cultural traits such as a mythological and religious complex, and a vigesimal (base
        20) numeric system, were diffused from the Mexican cultures to the rest of the Mesoamerican culture area.[39] In
        this period, villages became more dense in terms of population, becoming socially stratified with an artisan
        class, and developing into chiefdoms. The most powerful rulers had religious and political power, organizing the
        construction of large ceremonial centers.
    </p>
    <p>The earliest complex civilization in Mexico was the Olmec culture, which flourished on the Gulf Coast from around
        1500 BCE. Olmec cultural traits diffused through Mexico into other formative-era cultures in Chiapas, Oaxaca and
        the Valley of Mexico. The formative period saw the spread of distinct religious and symbolic traditions, as well
        as artistic and architectural complexes.[41] The formative-era of Mesoamerica is considered one of the six
        independent cradles of civilization. In the subsequent pre-classical period, the Maya and Zapotec civilizations
        developed complex centers at Calakmul and Monte Albán, respectively. During this period the first true
        Mesoamerican writing systems were developed in the Epi-Olmec and Zapotec cultures. The Mesoamerican writing
        tradition reached its height in the Classic Maya Hieroglyphic script. The earliest written histories date from
        this era. The tradition of writing was important after the Spanish conquest in 1521, with indigenous scribes
        learning to write their languages in alphabetic letters, while also continuing to create pictorial texts.
    </p>
    <p>In Central Mexico, the height of the classic period saw the ascendancy of Teotihuacán, which formed a military
        and commercial empire. Teotihuacan, with a population of more than 150,000 people, had some of the largest
        pyramidal structures in the pre-Columbian Americas.[44] After the collapse of Teotihuacán around 600 AD,
        competition ensued between several important political centers in central Mexico such as Xochicalco and Cholula.
        At this time, during the Epi-Classic, Nahua peoples began moving south into Mesoamerica from the North, and
        became politically and culturally dominant in central Mexico, as they displaced speakers of Oto-Manguean
        languages. During the early post-classic era (ca. 1000–1519 CE), Central Mexico was dominated by the Toltec
        culture, Oaxaca by the Mixtec, and the lowland Maya area had important centers at Chichén Itzá and Mayapán.
        Toward the end of the post-Classic period, the Mexica established dominance, establishing a political and
        economic empire based in the city of Tenochtitlan (modern Mexico City), extending from central Mexico to the
        border with Guatemala.[45] Alexander von Humboldt popularized the modern usage of "Aztec" as a collective term
        applied to all the people linked by trade, custom, religion, and language to the Mexica state and Ēxcān
        Tlahtōlōyān, the Triple Alliance.[46] In 1843, with the publication of the work of William H. Prescott, it was
        adopted by most of the world. This usage has been the subject of debate since the late 20th century.

    <h2>Spanish conquest and colonial era (1519–1821)</h2>
    <p>Although the Spanish Empire had established colonies in the Caribbean starting in 1493, only in the second decade
        of the sixteenth century did they begin exploring the east coast of Mexico. The Spanish first learned of Mexico
        during the Juan de Grijalva expedition of 1518. The Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire began in February 1519
        when Hernán Cortés founded the Spanish city of Veracruz. The 1521 capture of Tenochtitlan and immediate founding
        of the Spanish capital Mexico City on its ruins was the beginning of a 300-year-long colonial era during which
        Mexico was known as Nueva España (New Spain). Two factors made Mexico a jewel in the Spanish Empire: the
        existence of large, hierarchically organized Mesoamerican populations that rendered tribute and performed
        obligatory labor and the discovery of vast silver deposits in northern Mexico.</p>
    <p>
        The Kingdom of New Spain was created from the remnants of the Aztec empire. The two pillars of Spanish rule were
        the State and the Roman Catholic Church, both under the authority of the Spanish crown. In 1493 the pope had
        granted sweeping powers to the Spanish monarchy for its overseas empire, with the proviso that the crown spread
        Christianity in its new realms. In 1524, King Charles I created the Council of the Indies based in Spain to
        oversee State power in its overseas territories; in New Spain the crown established a high court in Mexico City,
        the Real Audiencia, and then in 1535 created the Viceroyalty of New Spain. The viceroy was highest official of
        the State. In the religious sphere, the diocese of Mexico was created in 1530 and elevated to the Archdiocese of
        Mexico in 1546, with the archbishop as the head of the ecclesiastical hierarchy. Castilian Spanish was the
        language of rulers. The Catholic faith was the only one permitted, with non-Catholics and Catholics (excluding
        Indians) holding unorthodox views being subject to the Mexican Inquisition, established in 1571.
    </p>
    <p>Spanish military forces, sometimes accompanied by native allies, led expeditions to conquer territory or quell
        rebellions through the colonial era. Notable Amerindian revolts in sporadically populated northern New Spain
        include the Chichimeca War (1576–1606),[50] Tepehuán Revolt (1616–1620),[51] and the Pueblo Revolt (1680), the
        Tzeltal Rebellion of 1712 was a regional Maya revolt.[52] Most rebellions were small-scale and local, posing no
        major threat to the ruling elites.[53] To protect Mexico from the attacks of English, French, and Dutch pirates
        and protect the Crown's monopoly of revenue, only two ports were open to foreign trade—Veracruz on the Atlantic
        (Connecting to Spain) and Acapulco on the Pacific (Connecting to the Philippines). Among the best-known pirate
        attacks are the 1663 Sack of Campeche[54] and 1683 Attack on Veracruz.[55] Of greater concern to the crown was
        of foreign invasion, especially after Britain seized in 1762 the Spanish ports of Havana, Cuba and Manila in the
        Seven Years' War. It created a standing military, increased coastal fortifications, and expanded the northern
        presidios and missions into Alta California. The volatility of the urban poor in Mexico City was evident in the
        1692 riot in the Zócalo. The riot over the price of maize escalated to a full-scale attack on the seats of
        power, with the viceregal palace and the archbishop's residence attacked by the mob.</p>
